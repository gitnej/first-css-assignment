<p>
    I am very excited to learn HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
    HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. Many organizations deploy website built with HTML structure.
    I am very delighted at the level we have gone so far. I am happy to meet amazing people in this cohort 4 and I am hoping to see all of us at the end of the class.
    I know it won’t be an easy journey, but I encourage everyone to gear up and we shall all smile at the end of the course.
    Our teachers are wonderful and I appreciate their calmness, and approach being used to deliver the course.
    We are now learning CSS, which stands for cascading style-sheets which is used to style and layout web pages.
    For example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
    There are three (3) types of CSS – External, Internal and Inline.
    External CSS is a file that HTML files will link to. Internal CSS is specified at the beginning of an HTML document. Inline CSS is written for a specific element in the HTML document.
